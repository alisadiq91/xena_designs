# **Ali Sadiq MS4 â€“ Xena Designs**

[View the live project here.]( https://xena-designs.herokuapp.com/)

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the fourth and final project of my software development career. I have decided to create an e-commerce site for a friend of mine who has a resin art business. The business currently makes all their sales through instagram and I feel as though a website will increase their sales massively. The website will give users the opportunity to view all the products, filter through them and purchase products, as well as many other functions. The site will be made using the Python framework Django, as it is something new that I have learnt over the last few months. I will also be using languages I have learnt in previous modules such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, as well as other frameworks. The main focus of this website is to create a fully functioning e-commerce store that is useful to guests, registered users and also the admin.

The website is called Xena Designs. They are a small business that creates resin products for use around the home, as well as other personalised products.

# **DESIGN**

## Colour Scheme

* The three main colours used are grey, white, and black.

## Typography

* The El Messiri (from google fonts) is the font used for this site, with different weights and italics. 

* Sans Serif is used as the fall-back font if for any reason the above font is not functioning. 

* A sharp, professional yet artsy theme is set which the El Messiri font achieves. The font is clear and easy to read.
